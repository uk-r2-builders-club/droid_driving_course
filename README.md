This adds an automatic score board system to the UK R2D2 Builders driving course

Existing wired sensors can be replaced with wireless ones, talking back to a central access point and this code running on a Pi. The Pi can have a monitor on it set up to automatically display the scoreboard.

== Installation ==

''' sudo apt-get install git python3-pip python3-future python3-flask '''

''' sudo pip3 install flask-socketio '''

''' mkdir ~/.r2_builders '''
